## Results:

- Population growth is very dangerous if it is not controlled but if it is used correctly, you can build a better future, As we saw, although the population growth is decreasing, it didn’t serve much good.

- So, we must stop blaming population growth for poor quality of life or bad economical situations, because human capital constitutes  the real wealth.
